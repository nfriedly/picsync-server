PicSync Server
======================

Notice: PicSync is no longer being developed or maintained, however, the existing code will remain free for anyone who wants to build on it or learn from it.

PicSync automatically uploads photos you take on on your phone to a private online album. 
Later, when you log into facebook, the app notifies you of new photos allowing you to 
review them and post your favorites.

This is the server package. It's written in node.js to run on Heroku and S3.

Note: this project is no longer under active development.
